PyGeoj
======

PyGeoj is a simple Python GeoJSON file reader and writer intended for
end-users. It exposees dictionary structures as high level objects with
convenience methods, so the user does not have to get caught up in the
details of the format specification.

Platforms
---------

So far only tested on Python version 2.x.

Dependencies
------------

Pure Python, no dependencies.

Installing it
-------------

PyGeoj is installed with pip from the commandline:

::

    pip install pygeoj

It also works to just place the "pygeoj" package folder in an importable
location like "C:/PythonXX/Lib/site-packages".

Example Usage
-------------

Begin by importing the pygeoj module:

::

    import pygeoj

Reading
~~~~~~~

Reading geojson formatted GIS files is a simple one-liner (requires the
geojson file to be a "FeatureCollection"):

::

    testfile = pygeoj.load(filepath="testfile.geojson")

Basic information about the geojson file can then be extracted, such as:

::

    len(testfile) # the number of features
    testfile.bbox # the bounding box region of the entire file
    testfile.crs # the coordinate reference system
    testfile.common_attributes # retrieves which field attributes are common to all features

Individual features can be accessed by their index in the features list:

::

    testfile[3]
    # or
    testfile.get_feature(3)

Or by iterating through all of them:

::

    for feature in testfile: 
        # do something

A feature can be inspected in various ways:

::

    feature.properties
    feature.geometry.type
    feature.geometry.coordinates
    feature.geometry.bbox

Editing
~~~~~~~

The standard Python list operations can be used to edit and swap around
the features in a geojson instance, and then saving to a new geojson
file:

::

    testfile[3] = testfile[8]
    # or testfile.replace_feature(3, testfile[8])
    del testfile[8]
    # or testfile.remove_feature(8)
    testfile.save("test_edit.geojson")

An existing feature can also be tweaked by using simple
attribute-setting:

::

    # set your own properties
    feature.properties = {"newfield1":"newvalue1", "newfield2":"newvalue2"}

    # borrow the geometry of the 16th feature
    feature.geometry = testfile[16].geometry

Constructing
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creating a new geojson file from scratch is also easy:

::

    newfile = pygeoj.new()

    # The data coordinate system defaults to long/lat WGS84 or can be manually defined:
    newfile.define_crs(type="link", link="http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/26912/esriwkt/", link_type="esriwkt")

The new file can then be populated with new features:

::

    newfile.add_feature(properties={"country":"Norway"},
                        geometry={type="Polygon", coordinates=[[(21,3),(33,11),(44,22)]]} )
    newfile.add_feature(properties={"country":"USA"},
                        geometry={type="Polygon", coordinates=[[(11,23),(14,5),(66,31)]]} )

Finally, some useful additional information can be added to top off the
geojson file before saving it to file:

::

    newfile.add_all_bboxes()
    newfile.add_unique_id()
    newfile.save("test_construct.geojson")
